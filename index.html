        <b>React Life Cycle Methods</b></p>

    <p><b> There are three Phases of React LifeCycle:-</b></p>

    <p> <b>1. Mounting<br>
     2.Updating<br>
     3.Unmounting</b></p>


    <p> <b>In Mounting Phase:-</b></p>
    <p> (i)Constructor<br>
        (ii)getDerivedStateFromProps<br>
        (iii)render<br>
        (iv)componentDidMount</p>

    <p><b> In Updating Phase:-</b><br>
        (i)getDerivedStateFromProps<br>
        (ii)shouldComponentUpdate<br>
        (iii)render<br>
        (iv)getSnapShotBeforeUpdate<br>
        (v)componentDidUpdate</p>

    <p><b> In Unmounting Phase:-</b></p>
    <p> (i)componentWillUnmount</p>



    <p> Explanation:-</p>

    <p><b> In Mounting Phase:-</b></p>
    <p> <b>(i)Constructor:-</b>Constructor method is the first method which is called, when the component is initiated,and it
        is used to set up the intial state and initial values.</p>

    <p> <b>(ii)getDerivedStateFromProps:- </b>The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the
        element(s) in the DOM.
        This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.
        It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.</p>

    <p> <b>(iii)render:-</b> The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.</p>

    <p><b>(iv)componentDidMount:-</b> The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
        This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.</p>


    <p><b> In Updating Phase:-</b></p><br>
    <p> <b>(i)getDerivedStateFromProps:- </b>This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.
        This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.</p>

    <p><b> (ii)shouldComponentUpdate:-</b> In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies
        whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
        The default value is true.</p>

    <p><b> (iii)render:-</b>The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML
        to the DOM, with the new changes.</p>

    <p><b> (iv)getSnapShotBeforeUpdate:-</b>In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state
        before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.</p>

    <p><b> (v)componentDidUpdate:-</b>The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.</p>


    <p> <b>In Unmounting Phase:-</b></p>
    <p> <b>(i)componentWillUnmount:-</b> The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed
        from the DOM.
